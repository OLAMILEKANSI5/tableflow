* Column Mapping
  * A process of aligning columns from one data source to another. The goal is to apparently establish relationships between corresponding columns in different data sources and ensured that data can be accurately transferred or synchronized*
* Webhook notifications (coming soon)
  * Webhook notifications provide a powerful mechanism for real-time communication between systems, facilitating seamless integration and enabling timely actions based on event-driven updates. It is a mechanism for two systems to communicate with each other by delivering data or events in near real-time.
* API to retrieve data (coming soon)
  * APIs – Data retrieval from the server or database in a structured and standardized manner.
* Data Validation (coming soon)
  * A process of ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and meets specific criteria or constraints. It’s mainly involves verifying and checking data for errors, completeness, integrity, and adherence to predefined rule.
